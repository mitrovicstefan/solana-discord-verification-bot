        <h2 class="block text-gray-700 text-lg font-bold mb-2">What is Discord verification?</h2>
        <div class="block text-gray-700 text-sm mb-2">
            The Discord verification service allows custom roles to be added to users who hold a specific NFT in their Solana wallet. These roles can be used to setup private channels and special features on your Discord server only available to your holders. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Once your project is configured, users simply navigate to a custom URL to verify their NFT status on your Discord server. Your verified users are continuously revalidated to ensure the role is removed if your NFT is no longer in their wallet.
        </div>
        <h2 class="block text-gray-700 text-lg font-bold mb-2">What is sales tracking?</h2>
        <div class="block text-gray-700 text-sm mb-2">
            Sales tracking continuously monitors your NFT collection for new mints and secondary market sales. Whenever activity is detected, we update your collection page and post a message to our community <a href="https://www.twitter.com/NFT4CauseBot">Twitter sales tracking bot</a>. 
            <br>
            <br>
            If you're an NFT 4 Cause NFT holder, we will also notify channels on your Discord server as well as your project's Twitter account. Custom sales notifications allow your followers to celebrate with you every time your collection exchanges hands.

        <h2 class="block text-gray-700 text-lg font-bold mb-2">Why is it free?</h2>
        <div class="block text-gray-700 text-sm mb-2">
            We offer these free hosted services because we believe in giving back to the Solana NFT community. Our mission is to enable projects to focus their funds on developing their community and making progress on their roadmap.
